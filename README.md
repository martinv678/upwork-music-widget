# Martin's Music Widget

To see the built widget and run it in an integration environment please run:

`yarn build`

To run the integration environment and see it running as it would in another site please run:

`yarn start:integration`

To use the widget in your own site, simply copy the `bundle.js` from the built integration file and add an html element to your DOM with the ID of `martins-test-widget`.

Enjoy.

If I had more time:

1. Tests... everything would have been tested.
2. Typescript... Miss it when I don't use it.
3. Potentially used CSS.
4. Would have written all the webpack stuff from scratch.
